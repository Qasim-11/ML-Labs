# ML-Labs

Welcome to my **ML-Labs** repository! This is where I dump all the code, notebooks, and projects I’ve been grinding on during my University Machine Learning course labs.

It’s a mix of foundational algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside?

The repo is organized by lab sessions. Each folder usually contains:

* **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):** The main playground where the code lives.
* **Datasets:** CSVs or links to data used for training.
* **Scripts:** Python files for specific ML tasks.

### Core Topics Covered:

* **Supervised Learning:** Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** K-Means Clustering, PCA.
* **Neural Networks:** Basic Perceptrons and Deep Learning intro.
* **Tools:** Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. I recommend using a virtual environment, or just use Colab, clone any notebook and skip everything:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

```

### Installation

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Running the Labs

Fire up the notebooks to see the magic:

```bash
jupyter notebook

```

## 📈 Example Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Picking the right variables.
3. **Training:** Feeding data to the model.
4. **Evaluation:** Checking Accuracy, F1-Score, and Mean Squared Error.

## 🤝 Contributing

Since these are my uni labs, it’s mostly just for my own tracking, but if you spot a bug or a way to optimize a model, feel free to open a PR!
